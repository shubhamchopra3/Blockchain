# Blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed database with a list (that is, chain) of records (that is, blocks) linked and secured by digital fingerprints (that is, cryptho hashes)

A blockchain uses

*the block timestamp (e.g. 1637-09-15 20:52:38) and 
*the hash from the previous block (e.g. edbd4e11e69bc399a9ccd8faaea44fb27410fe8e3023bb9462450a0a9c4caa1b) and finally
*the block data (e.g. Transaction Data...)
